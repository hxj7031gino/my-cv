                <p>My practice concerns the power relation of image, gender and social distribution, and existentialism. Significant debates of such are being destructed by the dominating but entertaining and fragmented communication technology. I attempt to subvert the present way of image and information communication and empower images the capacity of “de-spectacularization” with a revolutionary, being-in-the-world way of seeing.</p>

                <p>Gino Wong (b. 2000) is a Chinese multimedia artist based in London and Guangzhou. His works have been exhibited internationally in China and UK and purchased by HUAWEI. With a Master’s Degree in Fine Art Printmaking and a background of media study, his works concern the distortion and inauthenticity brought by the mass media in the modern era and attempt to rebuild a reciprocal relation between the human body and the living world, creating works in printmaking, painting, performance, and writing.</p>
